## Create Capital Project
Creating a capital project requires the project number, it's name and the parent fund center.  The fund center must be created first if it does not exists.

Checking the Is Updatable field ensures that the capital project's encumbrance will be updated during the DRMIS download.

Optionally select a procurement officer.  The selected procurement officer will be paired to the lines items that are under the given capital project.
