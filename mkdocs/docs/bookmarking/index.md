# Bookmarking

## Creating a bookmark
Most pages, including reports, can be bookmarked for faster future reference. When a BFT page can be bookmarked, a green button is displayed on the main toolbal as shown below.  For reports that take parameters by mean of an input form, a user can create several version by using different parameter.  This way, a report for Q1 could be created as well as one for Q2 while using same paramaters for other fields.
